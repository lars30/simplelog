I remember before we had David, someone telling me that the great thing about having kids is when they are old enough to have conversations with you, and how it gets better and better as they get older. Now that we're getting into David's fourth year, I can see how that's true.</body-raw>\n    <body-searchable>David continues to grow up quickly. In the last few weeks he's really been joking around a lot more than he ever has before. Most of these jokes are related to inserting the words pee pee or poopy into a song or a statement. \n\n \n\n Speaking of songs, it's really fun to hear him play around with melody. He knows a few songs now, so he will occasionally just start softly singing a tune to himself while he's playing. He also makes up little nonsense songs on his own, which I really enjoy as I've always enjoyed doing that myself. \n\n \n\n The other day he looked at Laura very seriously at the breakfast table, and said to her: \n\n \n David: Mom, I have something to tell you. \n \n Laura: Yes, David, what is it? \n \n David: Mom, I know you like apples. And I also know that Daddy likes apples. \n \n Laura: Yes \n \n David: But Mommy, I do not like apples. \n \n\n We naturally found this to be extremely amusing. \n\n \n\n I came home from work last week and David greeted me at the door. As I walked in I held up my hand and said \"High Five\". He looked at me and, out of nowhere ran me through the whole: \n\n \n \"Gimme Five, Up High, Down Low, Too Slow! \" routine. \n \n\n I don't know where he picked it up but he found it very amusing how stunned I was that he pulled it on me. \n\n \n\n It's amazing to play with him and talk to him. He's such a smart kid. I don't know how it's possible that he's about to turn 4 years old.
